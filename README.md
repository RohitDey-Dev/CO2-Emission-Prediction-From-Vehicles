# CO2-Emission-Prediction-From-Vehicles
This project predicts vehicle CO2 emissions using a Random Forest model with 96.59% accuracy, focusing on key factors such as engine size, cylinder count, and fuel consumption. Analyzing 3,105 vehicle records, it offers valuable insights for manufacturers to design more fuel-efficient vehicles and for policymakers to implement data-driven regulations. The analysis utilized Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn) and Power BI for interactive visualizations. Importantly, the project aligns with several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Climate Action (SDG 13) and Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), by providing data-driven strategies to mitigate emissions and promote sustainable transportation.
